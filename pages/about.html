                 Sunless (or Sunny), is the main character of Shadow Slave. Growing up in the outskirts and leading a life of deceit and focusing on his own survival,
                  he initially has a bleak outlook on life, even resigning himself to his fate when he was infected by the Nightmare Spell. But then, inside his First Nightmare,
                   he resolved to himself that he must survive, no matter what.
